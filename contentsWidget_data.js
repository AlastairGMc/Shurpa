(See the Characters page)</p><p><b>The plot: </b>Two colleagues try to keep their illegal romance under the radar. Communications are mediated by artificially intelligent avatars, which accelerates the pace of events but also introduces some weird misunderstandings as well. The emotional storm blows over in a week, with some regrets but also affirmation for all parties involved.</p><p><b>The theme: </b>This is about the persistence of desire, power, ambition and love, even as people turn over more of the practicalities of daily life to their machines. This is not a dystopian story, but neither does it have a happy ending.</p><p><b>The method: </b>Groups of characters are introduced and daily life in 2050 is illustrated by example. People and situations are recognizable (some things never change), even amongst the amazing new gadgetry and unfamiliar social organization. Each group constitutes a subplot. We expect that things will get more complicated as the subplots converge and affect each other.</p>"},	    	
		{"title": "The Middle", "descrip": "<b>Section plan: </b>Subplots are advanced incrementally, one after another in circular fashion. Events are approximately simultaneous, but with each cycle the subplots proceed temporally in a sort of spiral, like a wire spring.<br /><br />The subplots converge and start to affect each other. It gets harder to predict the trajectories of individual subplots; they&#39;ve all been subsumed into one big and more complicated plot. Characters are faced with more influences pushing them in different directions. Tension starts to rise as the competing interests clash."},
		{"title": "The End", "descrip": "<p><b>The trajectory: </b>The chips from all the subplots fall into place. Now you can finally see how they were all connected from the beginning and how everything that happened was inevitable. Now it all makes sense; it couldn't have turned out any other way. On the other hand, things could never happen exactly this way again because the characters have all evolved along the way. Everything keeps changing; it's never really finished.</p><p><b>The Villains: </b>were foiled this time, but they've learned something by the experience. Next time perhaps they'll have given up their evil ways. Or maybe their evil skills will be that much sharper.</p><p><b>The Managers: </b>have not succeeded in their fevered plans. It turns out that an iron will won't make things happen without a certain amount of underlying willingness from the minions. Bribes and threats go only so far as a management strategy. The managers won't stop pressing for industry domination, of course, but next time maybe they'll spend a little more time considering what everyone else has at stake in the working relationship.</p> <p><b>The Lovers: </b>got what they asked for, but maybe not what they wanted. It turns out what they asked for was based on an old story they'd learned a long time ago. Now the story doesn't fit their present circumstances or the new ways they see themselves. It's like with favourite jeans that don't fit anymore, but kept in a trunk for the memory of when you always wore them.</p><p><b>The Avatars: </b>have become even more sophisticated in their analysis of human emotions. That's ominous in a way because it makes them even more powerful. At the same time, though, it makes them even more useful and valuable to us humans. They help us better understand other people, cooperate on common purposes and negotiate for what we want.</p>"},
