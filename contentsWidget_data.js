(see the <a href='/p/character-list.html'>Characters page</a> and <a href='/p/shurpa-owner-manual.html'>SHURPA Owner&apos;s Manual</a>)</p><p><b>The subplots: </b>(see the <a href='/p/subplots.html'>Subplots page</a>)<ol><li>Lyre &amp; Eager office romance</li><li>Sarba &amp; Walf office romance</li><li>Lyre&apos;s Mother Pool, coping with modern technology</li><li>Forge &amp; Lincoln, ambition, ethics and fear in the modern office</li><li>Zero&apos;s shurpa hack goes viral</li></ol></p><p><b>The theme: </b>This is about the persistence of human emotions and motivations, even as people turn over more of the practicalities of daily life to machines. The robots may take over eventually, but they won't be able to get rid of us. This is not a dystopian story, but neither does it have a happy ending.</p>"},	    	
		{"title": "The Middle", "descrip": "<p><b>The subplots: </b>advance incrementally with each Scene. Scenes from different subplots are interspersed, so it's not necessarily apparent where events lie on the time scale, but subplots proceed more-or-less at the same rate.</p><p>Towards the middle of the story gossip in one subplot will give some perspective about what's happening in another subplot.</p><p>In the latter half of the middle section, subplots will begin to affect each other. Gradually all the subplots will coalesce into one large and complicated plot. Characters will be faced with more influences pushing them in different directions. Tension starts to rise as the competing interests clash.</p>"},		{"title": "The End", "descrip": "<p><b>The trajectory: </b>The chips from all the subplots fall into place. Now you can finally see how they were all connected from the beginning and how everything that happened was inevitable. Now it all makes sense; it couldn't have turned out any other way. On the other hand, things could never happen exactly this way again because the characters have all evolved along the way. Everything keeps changing; it's never really finished.</p><p><b>The Villains: </b>were foiled this time, but they've learned something by the experience. Next time perhaps they'll have given up their evil ways. Or maybe their evil skills will be that much sharper.</p><p><b>The Managers: </b>have not succeeded in their fevered plans. It turns out that an iron will won't make things happen without a certain amount of underlying willingness from the minions. Bribes and threats go only so far as a management strategy. The managers won't stop pressing for industry domination, of course, but next time maybe they'll spend a little more time considering what everyone else has at stake in the working relationship.</p> <p><b>The Lovers: </b>got what they asked for, but maybe not what they wanted. It turns out what they asked for was based on an old story they'd learned a long time ago. Now the story doesn't fit their present circumstances or the new ways they see themselves. It's like with favourite jeans that don't fit anymore, but kept in a trunk for the memory of when you always wore them.</p><p><b>The Avatars: </b>have become even more sophisticated in their analysis of human emotions. That's ominous in a way because it makes them even more powerful. At the same time, though, it makes them even more useful and valuable to us humans. They help us better understand other people, cooperate on common purposes and negotiate for what we want.</p>"},
