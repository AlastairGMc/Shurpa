Communications are mediated by artificially intelligent avatars, which accelerates the pace of events but introduces some weird misunderstandings as well. The emotional storm blows over in a week, with some regrets but also affirmation for all parties involved.</p><p><b>The intent: </b>This is about the universality of power, desire, ambition and love, even as people turn over more of the practicalities of daily life to their machines. This is not a dystopian story, but neither does it have a happy ending.</p><p><b>The beginning: </b>Groups of characters are introduced and daily life in 2050 is illustrated by example. People and situations are recognizable (some things never change), even amongst the amazing new gadgetry and unfamiliar social organization. Each group constitutes a subplot. We expect that things will get more complicated as the subplots converge and affect each other.</p>"},	    	{"title": "The Middle", "descrip": "<b>Section plan: </b>Subplots are advanced incrementally, one after another in circular fashion. Events are approximately simultaneous, but with each cycle the subplots proceed temporally in a sort of spiral, like a wire spring.<br /><br />The subplots converge and start to affect each other. It gets harder to predict the trajectories of individual subplots; they&#39;ve all been subsumed into one big and more complicated plot. Characters are faced with more influences pushing them in different directions. Tension starts to rise as the competing interests clash."},
		{"title": "The End", "descrip": "<b>Section plan: </b>Accommodations have been made as much as possible to ease the tensions, but patience has been bent to the breaking point. Finally something does break, and things resolve suddenly in unexpected ways.<br /><br />Our understanding of what happened, and why, shifts suddenly: now we reinterpret the previous events that led up to this point, and revise our expectations for how things will go in the future. Where before the break everything seemed confusing, now it all seems to make sense in light of the new circumstances, as if we should have known all along."},

The shurpas don't try to contradict their owners, but they assess the dangers and take up negotiating positions to mediate.<br /><br />Meanwhile, subplots are launched: <br />a) Fear & loathing at the office <br />b) Walf & Sarba tragic romance <br />c) Pool's travails with shurpas <br />d) Zero's new shurpa hack."},
